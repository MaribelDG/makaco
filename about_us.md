### **Research path**

<img src="images/karen.png" align="right"> 


I have a bachelor degree in Biology from Brazil at [Unila](https://portal.unila.edu.br/). There I researched the interaction of two bacteria, _Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus_ and _Azospirillum brasiliensis_, and a fungi, _Trichoderma harzianum_, with the Mate plant, _Ilex paraguariensis_, under the direction of [Cristian A. Rojas](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cristian_Rojas6) and [Cleto Peres](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cleto_Peres). 

I am currently doing my PhD in Quebec with [Hugo Germain](http://www.germainhugo.com/) and [Isabel Desgagne-Penix](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=3466) at [UQTR](http:/uqtr.ca) on **_Transcriptomics and metabolomics of Arabidopsis in response to fungal virulence proteins_**. Although my PhD program is in Cellular and molecular biology, I did all the analyses of my transcriptomic data and currently on my metabolomic data and I have collaborated in other projects throughout my PhD doing _de novo_ transcriptome assembly, annotation and differential exon usage.

In 2018, I did an internship at [Peter Solomon's lab](https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/academics/peter-solomon) with [Megan McDonald](https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/academics/megan-mcdonald), where I used MinIon to sequence the genome of several isolates of the fungus _Bipolaris sorokiniana_, basecalled the reads and assembled them and finally aligned the new genomes to a reference to study structural changes in the chromosomes.

I also developed a R package for selection of reference genes from transcriptomic data (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6426-2), you can access it on  [Github](https://github.com/KarenGoncalves/CustomSelection) too.

### **Research path**

<img src="images/maribel.png" align="right"> 

I am a biotechnology engineer with concentration in molecular biology, I obtained my degree at [ITESM](https://tec.mx/es) in Mexico. Nowadays, I am doing my Master degree in Quebec at [UQTR](https://www.uqtr.ca/informationgenerale/english.shtml) with [Isabel Desgagné-Penix](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=3466) as supervisor, working on **_The Characterization of Vanillin Synthase in a model diatom_**. 

I am expected to do a fast-track transfer to PhD to work on **_Transcriptomics of engineered microalgae_**, eventhough the program is in molecular and cellular biology, I will do the analysis of my data. 

I am working on the assembly and annotation of the transcriptome of _Leucojum aestivum_. Additionally, I have worked with metagenomics data to assign taxonomy to microbial populations from environmental samples in Mexico, analyzing differential compositions depending on crop and developmental stage.
